    <h1>Hi! I'm Ada Blakemore — Class of 2027</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Thanks so much for checking out my page! My name is Ada Blakemore, and I’ve been playing softball since I was nine years old. I’ve tried a bunch of sports, but softball has always been the one I love most — and I’m super excited to keep playing at the next level.</p>

      <p>I’m currently a sophomore at Lakeland High School (ID), where I start in center field and bat lead-off on varsity (#1). I also play for Coeur d’Alene Crush (#9), and this is my 7th year with the team! I've played second base, catcher, and outfield, but center field has become my main position.</p>

      <h2>📚 Off the Field</h2>
      <p>I’ve maintained a 4.0+ GPA all throughout high school and am a proud member of the National Honor Society. I started high school at a private Christian school, where I placed 3rd in the Poetry Out Loud competition and was named a Top Scholar.</p>

      <p>When I’m not on the field or in class, I work at a local artisan pizza parlor — and was one of four employees named Employee of the Year. I also help coach my little sister’s rec and travel teams, which I really love. Giving back to the game and watching younger players grow is super rewarding.</p>

      <p>I’m hardworking, competitive, and always trying to improve — on the field, in school, and in life. I’d love to continue playing softball in college and see where this sport takes me!</p>
